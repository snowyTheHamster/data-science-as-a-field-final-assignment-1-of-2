## data science as a field - final assignment (part 1 of 2)

notes: I have used some librarys that were not in the lecture, so I am instructed to make some references here:

- I used the tidyverse library, which includes ggplot2 for plotting, dplyr for data manipulation, and readr for reading data from csv files.
- While trying to knit my dataset, I was given an error, asking me to install Latex, which can be found here: https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html

Since this is my first time using R, I needed to follow a guide.
All or most of the basic commands I used can be found in this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ0bV2Afkjc
